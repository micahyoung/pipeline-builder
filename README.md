## Octo Pipelines
Octo Pipelines is a CLI that generates a collection of GitHub Workflows and other Github-related artifacts in a repository.  The pipeline generator takes a simplified descriptor as input and transforms it into more complicated workflows and artifacts.

### Getting Started
The command line can either be built or run directly using Go.

```shell
$: go run github.com/paketo-buildpacks/pipeline-builder/cmd/octo --descriptor <DESCRIPTOR>
```

The input is a YAML-based descriptor, examples of which can be found in `.github/pipeline-descriptor.yml` in other repositories.

### Common Workflows
Regardless of the contents of the descriptor the pipeline builder creates a minimal set of workflows and artifacts.

#### Dependendabot
* [Example `dependabot.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/dependabot.yml)

A [Dependendabot configuration file](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates) is added to all repositories.  It will always add an update for `github-actions`, and if the repository contains a `go.mod` file, it will also add an update for `gomod`.

#### Labels
* [Example Labels](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/labels)
* [Example `labels.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/labels.yml)
* [Example `synchronize-labels.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/synchronize-labels.yml)
* [Example `minimal-labels.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/minimal-labels.yml)

In order to facilitate the automated creation of draft releases and notes, a set of semver-scope labels (`semver:major`, `semver:minor`, and `semver:patch`) and type labels (`type:bug`, `type:dependency-upgrade`, `type:documentation`, `type:enhancement`, `type:question`, `type:task`) are added to the repository.  In addition, a workflow that enforces exactly one of each label is attached to every PR.

#### Pipeline Updater
* [Example `update-pipeline.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-pipeline.yml)

A pipeline-updating workflow is added to the repository to ensure that workflows are kept up to date as the `pipeline-builder` evolves.

#### Release Drafter
* [Example Release Notes](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
* [Example `release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/release-drafter.yml)
* [Example `update-draft-release.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-draft-release.yml)

Draft release notes are created on every commit to `main`.  These notes take into account every PR since the previous release in order to create a division of the types of changes that were made and the semver scope of the change to work out the next release number.

### Descriptor
The descriptor is a YAML document with a number of top-level keys that correspond to new workflows, modified workflows, or artifacts.  All top-level keys except `github` are optional.

#### `github` (REQUIRED)
```yaml
github:
  username: ${{ secrets.JAVA_GITHUB_USERNAME }}
  token:    ${{ secrets.JAVA_GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
`github` is an object the describes the GitHub identity that the pipeline should use in the many places that GitHub API access is required.  The token must be granted the `repo`, `write:packages`, and `workflow` scopes.

#### `codeowners`
```yaml
codeowners:
- path:  "*"
  owner: "@paketo-buildpacks/java-buildpacks"
```

* [Example `CODEOWNERS`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS)

`codeowners` is a list of objects test describe a `path` and `owner`.  Each of these objects corresponds to a line in [`CODEOWNERS`](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) file.

#### `package`
```yaml
package:
  repository:           gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk
  include_dependencies: false
  register:             true
  registry_token:       ${{ secrets.JAVA_REGISTRY_TOKEN }}
  platform:
    os: linux
```

* [Example `create-package.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-package.yml)
* [Example `test.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml)

`package` is an object that describes the `repository` a buildpackage should be published to as well as whether to include the buildpackage's dependencies when creating it (`false` by default).  If defined, a `create-package` workflow is created that creates and publishes a new package when a release is published as well as adds a `create-package` job to the tests workflow that is run on each PR and each commit.  It will also add additional content to the draft release notes about the contents of the build package and will update the digest of the buildpackage in the published release notes.  If `register` is `true`, after the package is created, it is registered with the [Buildpack Registry Index](https://github.com/buildpacks/registry-index).

`platform` describes what platform the created package should be built for. `os` can be set to `linux` or `windows` (`linux` by default).

#### `builder`
```yaml
builder:
  repository: gcr.io/projectriff/builder
```

* [Example `create-builder.yml`](https://github.com/projectriff/builder/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-builder.yml)
* [Example `test.yml`](https://github.com/projectriff/builder/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests.yml)

`builder` is an object that describes the `repository` a builder should be published to.  If defined, a `create-builder` workflow is created that's creates and publishes a new builder when a release is published as well as adds a `create-builder` job to the tests workflow that is run on each PR and each commit.  It will also add additional content to the draft release notes about the contents of the build package and will update the digest of the builder in the published release notes.  Finally it will add update workflows for the lifecycle and builder image elements of the `builder.toml` file.

#### `docker_credentials`
```yaml
docker_credentials:
- registry: gcr.io
  username: _json_key
  password: ${{ secrets.JAVA_GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}
```

`docker_credentials` is a list of objects that describes a `registry`, `username`, and `password` for authenticating against a Docker registry.  In every job that registry access is required, a [Docker Login Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-login) is created and conditionalized so that it will only run on pushes to `main` and on PRs that come from the same repository (to protect the secrets).

#### `http_credentials`
```yaml
http_credentials:
- host:     download.aquasec.com
  username: ${{ secrets.AQUA_SECURITY_USERNAME }}
  password: ${{ secrets.AQUA_SECURITY_PASSWORD }}
```

`http_credentials` is a list of objects that describe a `host`, `username`, and `password` for authenticating requests against an HTTP endpoint.  In every job that HTTP access is required a [`.netrc` file](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html) is written and conditionalized so that it will only be written on pushes to `main` and on PRs that come from the same repository (to protect the secrets).

#### `dependencies`
```yaml
dependencies:
- name:            JRE 11
  id:              jre
  version_pattern: "11\\.[\\d]+\\.[\\d]+"
  uses:            docker://ghcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/actions/adopt-openjdk-dependency:main
  with:
    implementation: hotspot
    type:           jre
    version:        "[11,12)"
```

* [Example `update-*.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-jre-11.yml)

`dependencies` is a list of objects that define how dependencies are detected and updated by describing an optional `name` (defaults to `id`), `id` that matches a `buildpack.toml` defined dependency id, an optional `version_pattern` that defines which dependency with a given `id` to update, a `uses` to define which GitHub Action to use to find the next version, and a `with` used to configure the GitHub action to use to find the next version.  If defined, each object will create an `update` workflow that is responsible for detecting a new version, updating `buildpack.toml` and opening a PR to include the change in the repository, if appropriate.

#### `test`
```yaml
test:
  steps:
  - name: Install richgo
    run: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

      set -euo pipefail

      GO111MODULE=on go get -u -ldflags="-s -w" github.com/kyoh86/richgo
  - name: Run Tests
    run: |
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

      set -euo pipefail

      richgo test ./...
    env:
      RICHGO_FORCE_COLOR: "1"
```

`test` is an object that allows you to override the default test configuration by specifying a list of `steps` as defined by the [GitHub Actions reference documentation][gha].  The default value is described in the example above.

[gha]: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idsteps

#### `path`
```yaml
path: ..
```

`path` is a pointer to a Git repository, on your local filesystem, where files will be created.  If unspecified, the default is `..`.

#### `offline_packages`
```yaml
offline_packages:
- source: paketo-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk
  target: gcr.io/tanzu-buildpacks/adopt-openjdk
  platform:
    os: linux
```

`offline_packages` is a list of objects that describe a `source` GitHub repository and a `target` Docker registry location.  If defined, each object will create a `create-package` workflow that is responsible for detecting a new online buildpackage release and creating a matching offline buildpackage release and publishing it.

`platform` describes what platform the created package should be built for. `os` can be set to `linux` or `windows` (`linux` by default).

#### `actions`
```yaml
actions:
- source: adopt-openjdk-dependency
  target: ghcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/actions/adopt-openjdk-dependency
```

* [Example `create-action-*.yml`](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/pipeline-builder/blob/main/.github/workflows/create-action-adopt-openjdk-dependency.yml)

`actions` is a list of objects that describe a `source` directory within this repository's `actions/` directory, and a `target` Docker registry location.  If defined, each object will create a `create-action` workflow that is responsible for building and publishing new versions of the action.

## Actions
